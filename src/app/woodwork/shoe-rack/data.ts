export const shoeRackDescription = `
  This shoe rack was built using reclaimed wood from old IKEA shelves, making it both 
  an economical and environmentally friendly project. The design focuses on simplicity 
  and functionality, with angled shelves to better accommodate different shoe sizes.
  
  The project required precise measurements to fit the available space in the closet 
  and careful planning to make the most of the limited materials. The finish was 
  chosen to match the existing closet shelving for a cohesive look.
